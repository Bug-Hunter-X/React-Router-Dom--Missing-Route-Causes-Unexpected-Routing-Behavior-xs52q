# React Router Dom: Missing Route Causes Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router Dom v6 where omitting a route definition for a given path can lead to unexpected behavior.  The application might render nothing, the wrong component, or throw an error. This is especially problematic when handling deep links or dynamic routes.

## Bug
The `App.js` file contains a `Routes` component that is missing a route definition for the path '/contact'. This leads to the app not displaying the Contact component when the user navigates to '/contact'.

## Solution
The `AppSolution.js` file demonstrates the fix, adding the missing route definition for the path '/contact' to correctly render the Contact component.
